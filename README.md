As a final project for an AI class I took, we created a group project which was a review of a new AI Paper "Designing Biological Sequences without Prior Knowlede Using Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning". That review is included here.

This review was created in conjunction with three other students which are listed as authors in the paper. I contributed most heavily towards sections 2 and 3, but also made lighter contributions all throughout the paper.
